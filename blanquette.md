# La Blanquette 

As an excellent French replacement for a British Sunday roast, the blanquette will amaze your *demoiselle*, guaranteed. Traditionally a bit of a posh dish, *la blanquette* is an important pillar of French culinary culture.

Its name comes from its colour: white (which translates to *blanc* in French).

To be fair, all white meats can be prepared *"en blanquette"*, so do feel free to experiment with turkey and chicken, as well as with pork if it's the end of the month, or rabbit if you found a tener in the street.

## Ingredients

* 1l stock
* 1kg boneless shoulder/back rib of veal
* 400g button mushroom, trimmed and halved
* White wine. 250ml is fine, but you'll want more
* A pot double cream, not fat-free stuff
* 2 leeks. Trim and chop them proper
* 3 sticks celery. Chopped too
* 2 shallots, chopped
* 3 carrots, chopped
* Lemon juice
* Some garlic
* 300g pasta
* 25g butter
* 3 egg yolk
* Rosemary

## Recipe

You'll want to pour the stock and the wine in a pan - a rather large one. Add to it all the weird vegetables above, except the mushrooms. That includes the garlic and rosemary.  
Brind to the boil, simmer simmer for probably 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, remove the fat from the veal, and cut into large cubes. Slice your mushrooms in half, and add both the meat and the mushrooms to the pan. Cook for a while until meat is tender (probably about 30 minutes).

The stew thus created can be freezed, so do take it off the heat. Alternatively, keep it on low heat.

## Blanquette stands for *white*

Before we head to last minute things, boil the tagilatelle. Read the pack instructions. As an alternative, you can - and probably should in Lyon - replace the tagliatelle with white rice.

Now, the crucial bit of the blanquette is a strange mixture of cream and yolks. Beat them together at the last minute, since you do not want to overheat it. So when you're ready to serve, return the stew to a simmer and mix in yolks and cream. Stir in until the stew thickens.

Add some butter, and the lemon juice. `:tada:`
