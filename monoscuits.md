# Monoscuits

_Biscuits_ are little dry cookies, usually sweet. According to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscuit#Etymology),

> The Old French word bescuit is derived from the Latin words bis (twice) and
> coquere, coctus (to cook, cooked), and, hence, means "twice-cooked".

Our variant is cooked only once, hence the name "monoscuit".

## Ingredients

For a good number of biscuits:

- butter, 175g, detailed in small pieces and at room temperature
- sugar, 250g
- whole egg, 1
- egg yolk, 1
- flour, 350g
- pinch of salt

Variants include replacing part of the flour with ground almonds, and adding
some vanilla extract.

## Recipe

Set the oven to pre-heat at 200Â°C.

Whip together the butter and sugar until the mix becomes white and foamy.

Mix in the egg and egg yolk, and the flour.

Form the cookies on a cooking plate, using the method of your choice:
- flatten a small dollop of dough between your palms, or
- use a [cookie press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_press)

Cook for about 10 minutes, checking regularly that the cookies are not
overcooking.
