# La quiche Lorraine

This is a recipe for a *real* _quiche Lorraine_. It doesn't have cheese. Keep
the cheese to do other quiches or pies. The foundation of the real _quiche
Lorraine_ is what is called a [migaine](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migaine),
a mixture of eggs and cream.

Since there are so few ingredients, their quality is important: prefer
non-smoked [lardons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lardon), real full-fat [crème
fraiche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8me_fra%C3%AEche) (full-fat double
cream) for maximal authenticity.

The choice of pastry is important. Traditionally, a _pâte brisée_ (shortcrust
pastry) is used. This is very easy to make at home. Something to try is to use a
_pâte feuilletée_ instead (puff pastry). This is much harder to make at home, but
possible. Buying a pre-rolled pastry of good quality is a perfectly acceptable
route.

## Ingredients

Serves 6 (but more realistically 4); about 45min total, 10min active time

- _pâte brisee_ or _pâte feuilletée_ (shortcrust pastry or puff pastry), about 200
  to 300g
- _crème fraiche épaisse entière_ (full fat double-cream), 400g
- egg yolks, 3
- whole eggs, 3
- _lardons_ non-smoked, 150g (non-smoked bacon cut in _lardons_)
- pepper of your choice, to taste
- nutmeg, to taste

## Recipe

Set the oven to pre-heat at 200°c.

Cook the _lardons_ in a pan until really golden but not burnt. Don't add any fat
there.

In a bowl, whisk the cream, the egg yolks and eggs, plus the spices. Don't add
salt (the _lardons_ are salty enough usually). The whisking step is critical.
Whisk at least 5 real minutes (this is supposed to be long and annoying), or you
can of course use a kitchen mixer or the like with a whisking attachment. Near
the end of the whisking process, add the _lardons_ and whisk again.

Unroll the pastry in a pie dish (possibly still on its paper, butter the dish
generously if not using paper, and don't forget to prick the pastry if using
puff pastry). Push with your fingers all around the crust area so that it's
sticking to the side of the dish and stays upright. Don't skip this step, as the
moisture of the _migaine_ has a tendency to make the pastry fold back inward
while in the oven. This cannot really be fixed afterwards and makes for a messy crust,
ruining what is arguably the best part of the _quiche_.

Pour the _migaine_ in the dish. At this stage, you might want to re-distribute
the _lardons_ so that they spread evenly in the egg & cream mixture. It's ideal
to not wait to much during those steps. Whisking the _migaine_ allows
incorporating air bubbles in the filling, which lowers the density of the quiche
and is key to the success of this recipe.

Lower the oven temperature to 180°C, and place the quiche low in the oven, for
about 35 minutes. If everything goes right, the _migaine_ should raise above the
level of the pastry near the end of the cooking time. Pay attention to the
coloration pattern visible at the top of the filling; depending on how uniformly
your oven heats, you may have to rotate the quiche to make the coloration
even. Try to keep the oven door open for as little as possible while doing so.

Once cooked, rush it out of the oven, slice in 6 (but more realistically 4), and
eat while it's still really hot. It will be all puffy for a few minutes, and
then fall again, this is normal.

On the side, a simple green salad is perfect. A powerful olive oil/balsamic
_vinaigrette_ with finely chopped dill works well with this dish.

Quiches keep wonderfully in the fridge for a few days, and are excellent cold
the next day, but can also be re-heated.

## Bonus

Anne-Sophie Pic (8 Michelin stars) says that a nice twist is to add a generous table spoon &ndash; about 20g &ndash; of
[Savora](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savora) to the _migaine_. Of course, she is right.
